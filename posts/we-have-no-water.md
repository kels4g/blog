**We Have No Water**

Not great words to wake up to when you're in an area where the snow is "asshole deep" as my Dad says. Nonetheless, it was true. Our pipes had frozen overnight. 

Windi is equipped with tank heaters for the waste tanks and all of our plumbing is indoors and not exposed to the outside air so we thought it'd be fine. I mean, it was in Colorado!

And it was a tense few minutes in Windi as I tried to wipe sleep from my eyes and formulate a plan- while Stephen was half cooking waffles and half yelling that this was going to cost tens of thousands of dollars to fix.

So, off to google I go to learn what to do when you accidentally freeze your RV's pipes. Of all the methods presented (and one involved a blow torch- um no), I decided that the best option would be to put one of our space heaters in the bay and slowly warm the temperature to above 32 degrees to unthaw the lines. All while hoping that the pipes wouldn't burst.

Then I set about designing a solution so that it won't happen again. Stephen was sent out to find a heater that could be left in the bay to keep the temperature above freezing, while I stayed home and monitored our frozen pipes and tried to get just a trickle of water through the faucet. Over the next two hours, the water started flowing in stages. Approximately one new source of water per 30 minutes. While at the store, Stephen decided to get a remote monitoring system so that we can always see what the exact temperature is where the water pipes are. As I am typing this, they are at a toasty 50 degrees. Crisis averted. Water flowing. No broken pipes.

These are the heaters we are using http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/honeywell-200-250-watt-personal-heater-0435100p.0435100.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwkpfWBRDZARIsAAfeXaqe6iZH5dCc8iNCSDVGZudpdkUocPXaBwMKnsTTfFaMVsIlikl9OTUaAkLFEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CK7VmZvDpNoCFUXG4wcdW3AHmA#store=360 and this temperature monitoring system http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/la-crosse-wireless-weather-thermometer-indoor-outdoor-1427129p.html
